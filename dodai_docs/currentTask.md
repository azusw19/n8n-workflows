# Current Task: Implement Core Functionality & Styling

## Objective
- Implement the basic HTML structure (`index.html`).
- Apply initial CSS styling (`style.css`) based on the provided image reference.
- Implement core JavaScript logic (`script.js`) for:
    - Toggling widget visibility (bubble click, close button).
    - Switching between initial view and conversation view.
    - Handling user input and sending messages to the n8n webhook.
    - Receiving responses from the webhook and displaying messages.
    - Generating and storing a unique `chat_id`.

## Context
- The foundational structure, styling, and core interactive logic are now in place.
- The widget should be functional for basic chat interactions via the webhook.

## Next Steps
- Test the widget functionality thoroughly (opening/closing, sending/receiving messages).
- Refine CSS styling for closer resemblance to the image (icons, spacing, fonts).
- Implement "Bot is typing..." indicator (optional).
- Add error handling improvements.
- Update documentation (`codebaseSummary.md`).
