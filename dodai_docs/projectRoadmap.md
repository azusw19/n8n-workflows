# Project Roadmap: n8n Chatbot Widget

## High-Level Goal
- [ ] Create a modern, interactive chatbot widget that connects to an n8n webhook.

## Key Features
- [ ] Floating bubble button to toggle chat visibility.
- [ ] Initial welcome screen (based on provided image).
- [ ] Conversation view for user/bot interaction.
- [ ] Send user messages to n8n webhook (`https://pruna.app.n8n.cloud/webhook-test/9f8c4211-2bf8-4c78-8173-5558a13b9d94`).
- [ ] Receive and display bot responses from the webhook.
- [ ] Use a unique `chat_id` (stored in localStorage) for session persistence.
- [ ] Styling based on the provided image (modern, minimal, gradient).
- [ ] Basic responsiveness.

## Future Considerations
- Add functionality to placeholder links (Help Center, Free Trial, etc.).
- Implement "Bot is typing..." indicator.
- Enhance error handling.
- Advanced mobile responsiveness.
